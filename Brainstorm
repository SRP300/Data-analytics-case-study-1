STEP 1: ASK
Business Task: Assess whether AI-generated content adoption improves business outcomes (revenue, consumer trust, and market share) across industries.

Stakeholders: Marketing departments and Agencies across different industries 

Follow up questions:

-Which industries show the greatest Revenue Increase (%) from AI-generated content adoption between 2020â€“2025?
-Is there a clear correlation between AI Adoption Rate (%) and Revenue Increase (%) across industries and countries?
-How does Consumer Trust in AI (%) vary with higher adoption and ROI? Do industries with strong ROI risk lower trust?
-What is the relationship between Human-AI Collaboration Rate (%) and Job Loss Due to AI (%)? Can collaboration reduce negative workforce impacts while still boosting ROI?
-Do countries with active AI Regulation Status show different ROI or trust levels compared to unregulated markets?
